The Base Object can be directly used as a simple, empty widget. It is nothing more then a (rounded) rectangle.

You can use it as a background shape for other objects by putting its jsonl line before the object. It catches touches!

??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    ```json linenums="1"
    {"page":1,"id":50,"obj":"obj","x":5,"y":35,"w":230,"h":250,"click":0}
    ```
