<h1>Objecten</h1>

There are two ways to create an object on the screen:

- Uploading a [`pages.jsonl`](../pages#pagesjsonl) file onto the internal flash
- Use the [`jsonl`](../commands#multiple-commands) command *(via MQTT, serial or telnet console)*

## Common Parameters

### Common Properties

These are the common properties shared among all objects,
but only the `id` and `obj` properties are required to create an object:

| Property | Value     | Required | Default | Description
|:---------|:---------:|:--------:|:-------:|:----
| id       | 1..255    | yes      | n/a     | ID of the object on this page
| obj      | string    | yes      | n/a     | Name of the object type _(see below)_ 
| page     | 0..12     | no       | n/a     | ID of the page the object appears on _(see below)_
| groupid  | 0..15     | no       | 0 (none)| ID of the [GPIO group][3] the object belongs to
| x        | int16     | no       | 0       | horizontal position on the page
| y        | int16     | no       | 0       | vertical position on the page
| w        | int16     | no       | 0       | width of the object
| h        | int16     | no       | 0       | height of the object
| hidden   | [bool][2] | no       | false   | object is hidden
| opacity  | 0..255    | no       | 255     | how much the the object is opaque
| radius   | uint16    | no       | depends<BR>on theme | the radius of the rounded corners of the object:<BR>`0` square corners<BR>`100` pill shaped object (true circle if object has same width and height)
| action   | string    | no       | 0       | command handled locally _(see below)_
| swipe    | [bool][2] | no       | false   | page navigation using swipe gestures _(see below)_
| click    | [bool][2] | no       | true    | object is touch/clickable _(also see [enabled][4])_
| ext_click_h | 0..255 | no       | 0       | extended horizontal clickable are on the left and right 
| ext_click_v | 0.255  | no       | 0       | extended vertical clickable are on the top and bottom

!!! note
    Further customizable properties can be found in [styling](../styling).

#### Pages  
If the `page` parameter is not present, the object is placed on the same page as the _previous object_. If `page` is not specified for the first object either, the _current page_ being displayed is used.

`"page":0` indicates that the object is visible on **all** pages. It can be used for example to specify a static menu bar.
You can still hide the object on select pages if needed. Objects on page 0 appear on **top** of any objects on the underlying page.

#### Actions  
Action commands are supported only by _binary_ or _visual_ type of objects and they are performed locally on the plate. The following actions can be set for these objects:

- `p1` to `p12` to switch to the corresponding page numbers directly
- `prev` to switch to the previous page
- `next` to switch to the next page
- `back` to go back to the home page

Check out the [example](example-pagination) for how to implement actions.  
You can change the target pages using `prev`, `back` and `next` [page attributes](../pages#page-attributes) operation on the page object`pXb0`.  

#### Swipe  
Objects and page area (`p0bY`) support `swipe` property. Enabling this will process `left`, `right` and `down` swipes on the object as `next`, `prev` and `back` page changes, respectively. The start of the swipe needs to be on the element which has this property enabled for the feature to activate.  
_Note:_ Page id `p0b0` is not valid to set this property as it has to be set on real elements. 

### Events

All objects are touchable by default and respond to touch events. To disable touch events for an object set its `enabled` property to `false`. In this case the touch event "goes through" to the object on the layer below or to the page itself.

Events (and values) are published in a state topic corresponding to the object, eg. `hasp/<nodename>/state/p1b2` with payload in json format eg. `{"event":"up","val":1}`.  
Possible events (depending on object type) are:

| Event   | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `down`| Occurs when a button goes from depressed to pressed (the moment of touch)|
| `up`| The button was released within a short time i.e. a short press has occurred|
| `release`| The button is released after being pressed for over the threshold time|
| `long` | Event is sent when the button is *still* being pressed after the threshold time of 400ms|
| `hold`| The HOLD event is repeated every 200ms while the button is still pressed|
| `changed` | Event is sent when the value of the object has changed during the event|
<!-- - `LOST`: This event occurs when the object looses the focus while the screen is still being touched -->

_Tip:_ To actively see the sent out events you can use an MQTT client app and subscribe to the `hasp/#` topic.

### Common Methods

These are the common methods shared among all objects,

| Method   | Parameters | Description |
|:---------|:----------:|:------------|
| `clear`    |            | Delete the children from the object
| `delete`   |            | Delete the object and its children from the page
| `to_front` |            | Bring the object to the front on the page
| `to_back`  |            | Send the object to the back on the page

Example commands:

```json linenums="1"
p1b5.delete
p1b3.to_front
```
<H2>Object Types</H2>

Each object type is an ID that indicates which object type that line represents.
Besides the common properties listed above, each object type can have specific properties.

## Text Label
**obj:`label`**

![lv_label](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_label_1.png){: align=center }

| Property | Value      | Default    | Description
|----------|------------|------------|--------------
| text     | string     | "Text"     | The text of the label, `\n` for line break.
| mode     | string     | `crop`     | The wrapping mode of long text labels:<br>`expand` Expand the object size to the text size<br>`break` Keep the object width, break the too long lines and expand the object height<br>`dots` Keep the size and write dots at the end if the text is too long<br>`scroll` Keep the size and roll the text back and forth<br>`loop` Keep the size and roll the text circularly<br>`crop` Keep the size and crop the text out of it
| align    | 0..2       | 0       | Text alignment: `0` = left, `1` = center, `2` = right

Example `jsonl`:
```json linenums="1"
{"page":1,"id":1,"obj":"label","x":0,"y":50,"w":150,"h":50,"text":"\uE64A Hello world!"}
```

| val      | int16      | 0       | The value: `0` = untoggled, `1` = toggled
| text     | string     | ""      | The text of the label
| mode     | string     | `expand`| The wrapping mode of long text labels.<br>`expand` Expand the object size to the text size<br>`break` Keep the object width, break the too long lines and expand the object height<br>`dots` Keep the size and write dots at the end if the text is too long<br>`scroll` Keep the size and roll the text back and forth<br>`loop` Keep the size and roll the text circularly<br>`crop` Keep the size and crop the text out of it
| align    | 0..2       | 0       | Text alignment: `0` = left, `1` = center, `2` = right


Example `jsonl`:

{"page":1,"id":3,"obj":"btn","x":125,"y":40,"w":105,"h":90,"toggle":true,"text":"Toggle Button","mode":"break","align":1}
```

**Normal** buttons (`toggle=false`) send touch events while they occur: 

Short touch:
```json linenums="1"
{"event":"down"}
{"event":"up"}
```

Long press:
```json linenums="1"
{"event":"down"}
{"event":"long"}
{"event":"hold"}
{"event":"hold"}
{"event":"release"}
```

Toggle ON:
```json linenums="1"
{"event":"down","val":0}
{"event":"up","val":1}
```

Toggle OFF:

| format         | uint16     | 0       | divider for major tick values

To strip trailing zero's of major tick labels the `format` divider can be used to scale the values before printing:

- `0` : print the major tick value as is
- `1` : strip 1 zero, i.e. divide tick value by 10 before printing the major tick label
- `2` : strip 2 zeros, i.e. divide tick value by 100 before printing the major tick label
- `3` : strip 3 zeros, i.e. divide tick value by 1000 before printing the major tick label
- `4` : strip 4 zeros, i.e. divide tick value by 10000 before printing the major tick label

Only these values are allowed, arbitrary numbers are not supported.

Example `jsonl`:
```json linenums="1"

Use [scale][8] properties to customize.


## Tabview
**obj:`tabview`**

![lv_tabview](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_tabview_1.png)

A tabview is an object that can hold multiple tab objects.

| count    | int        | 0       | *Read-only* The number of tabs of the tabview

To change the currently visible tab, use the `val` attribute after all tabs have been added.

Example `jsonl`:
```json linenums="1"
{"page":1,"id":10,"obj":"tabview","btn_pos":1}
```


## Tab
**obj:`tab`**

| Property | Value      | Default | Description
|----------|------------|---------|--------------------------
| parentid | int8       | 0       | The `id` of the tabview object to which this tab is added
| text     | string     | "Tab"   | The name of tab

Set the parent object by referencing the `parentid` in the tab. It must be a `tabview` object.

Example `jsonl`:
```json linenums="1"

To add other objects to these tabs, also use the `parentid` when creating those objects.


## Color picker
**obj:`cpicker`**

![lv_cpicker](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_cpicker_1.png){: align=center }

| Property | Value      | Default | Description
|----------|------------|---------|--------------
| color    | [color][1] | 0       | The selected color in html format #rrggbb
| scale_width | int     | 25      | The width of the color gradient of the circle
| pad_inner | int       | 10      | The padding between the circle and the inner preview circle

The object will automatically adjust based on the `w` and `h` properties: when the object is longer then it is height a rectangular color picker is created, otherwise it will be circular.

By long pressing the inner preview circle, the color picker will through the color modes: hue > saturation > value. Double-click on the inner preview circle to reset the current value.

#### Setting Color

Example MQTT commands:
```json linenums="1"
hasp/<nodename>/command/p0b2.color 13891
hasp/<nodename>/command/p1b5.color silver
hasp/<nodename>/command/p2b3.color #C0C0C0
```

#### Events

While pressing and dragging the `cpicker` object the following events are sent: `down` (old color), `changed` (repeatedly until released) and `up` (value at the moment of releasing it):

```json linenums="1"
{"event":"down","color":"#8300ff","r":131,"g":0,"b":255}
{"event":"changed","color":"#7300ff","r":115,"g":0,"b":255}
{"event":"changed","color":"#6200ff","r":98,"g":0,"b":255}
{"event":"up","color":"#6200ff","r":98,"g":0,"b":255}
```

## Spinner
**obj:`spinner`**

![lv_spinner](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_spinner_1.png){: align=center }

| Property  | Value      | Default | Description
|-----------|------------|---------|--------------
| speed     | int16      | 1000    | The time for 1 turn in ms
| direction | int16      | 0       | `0` = clockwise, `1` = counter-clockwise
| angle     | 0-360      | 60      | The length of the arc in degrees

!!! note
    Placing objects over/under the spinner will increase the CPU load because all objects need to be redrawn constantly.

## LED Indicator
**obj:`led`**

![lv_led](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_led_1.png){: align=center }

| Property   | Value      | Default | Description
|------------|------------|---------|---------------
| val        | byte       | 0       | The brightness of the indicator [`0..255`]


## Button Matrix
**obj:`btnmatrix`**

![lv_btnmatrix](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_btnmatrix_1.png){: align=center }

| Property | Value      | Default    | Description
|----------|------------|------------|--------------
| options  | json array | "Text"     | Json array of strings where each element is the label of a button. Use `"\n"` for a new line of buttons
| align    | 0..2       | 1          | Text alignment: `0` = left, `1` = center, `2` = right
| toggle   | [bool][2]  | false      | All buttons behave as toggle buttons or normal buttons
| one_check| [bool][2]  | false      | Allow only one button to be checked (toggled) at once

The [styling properties](../styling) apply to *all* buttons in the matrix.
To change the color of a single label you can prefix the text with a `#RRGGBB` hexadecimal color code and close with a single hash `#` tag.

Example `jsonl`:
```json linenums="1"
{"page":1,"id":20,"obj":"btnmatrix","x":10,"y":10,"w":220,"h":150,"options":["#FF0000 Red Text#","#0000FF Cyan Text#","\n","#FFFF00 Yellow Text#"],"toggle":1,"one_check":1}
```


## Messagebox
**obj:`msgbox`**

![lv_msgbox](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_msgbox_1.png)

| Property | Value      | Default | Description
|----------|------------|---------|--------------------------
| text     | string     | ""      | The text of the message to be displayed
| options  | json array | ["OK"]  | Json array of strings where each element is the label of a button
| ~~modal~~    | [bool][2]  | false   | Make the messagebox a modal dialog requiring user input
| auto_close | int16    | 0       | Close the pop-up message automatically after this number of milliseconds have passed

The Message boxes act as a pop-up. The default width is the horizontal screen size, the height adjusts according to the contents of the message.
The pop-up is centered on the screen.

!!! note
    The messagebox object is automatically deleted when it is closed. You will need to create it again using `jsonl` to pop-up a new message.

Example `jsonl`:
```json linenums="1"
{"page":1,"id":24,"obj":"msgbox","text":"A message box with two buttons","options":["Apply","Close"]}
```


## Image
**obj:`img`**

| Property | Value      | Default | Description
|----------|------------|---------|--------------------------
| src      | string     | ""      | The name of the image file
| auto_size| bool       | true    | Automatically set the size of the image object to the image source
| offset_x | int        | 0       | Shift the picture horizontally relative to the image object
| offset_y | int        | 0       | Shift the picture vertically relative to the image object

You can use image_recolor and image_recolor_opa from the [image styling][5] properties to apply a color overlay mask.

Example `jsonl`:
```json linenums="1"
{"page":1,"id":34,"obj":"img","src":"/littlefs/image.png","auto_size":0,"w":50}
```


## Base Object
**obj:`obj`**

![lv_base_object](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_base_object_1.png)

The Base Object can be directly used as a simple, empty widget. It is nothing more then a (rounded) rectangle.

You can use it as a background shape for other objects by putting its jsonl line before the object. It catches touches!
