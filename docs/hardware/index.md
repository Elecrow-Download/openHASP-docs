# Getting Started

openHASP supports the ESP32 family of microcontrollers.
It needs a compatible micro-controller with drivers supporting the attached display, touch controller, storage and network.

Below is a list of recommended devices, development boards and touchscreens to get you up-and-running in no time.

## Recommended Devices

!!!tip
    For new projects we recommend ESP32-WROVER boards with PSram and at least 8MB of flash.
    A capacitive touchscreen is also highly prefered over resistive touchscreen.

Due to the large number of possible hardware options a selection of 3 popular ESP development boards has been made for the precompiled binaries.
