# Getting Started

openHASP supports the ESP32 family of microcontrollers.
It needs a compatible micro-controller with drivers supporting the attached display, touch controller, storage and network.

Below is a list of recommended devices, development boards and touchscreens to get you up-and-running in no time.

## Devices Recommendations

For new projects we recommend ESP32-S3 boards with at least 520 kB SRAM, 8MB of flash and 2MB PSram.
A capacitive touchscreen is also highly prefered because it is more responsive over resistive touchscreens.

!!! note
    We do not recommend using an ESP32-S2 because it only has 320 kB of SRAM.

Due to the large number of possible hardware options a selection of 3 popular ESP development boards has been made for the precompiled binaries.
