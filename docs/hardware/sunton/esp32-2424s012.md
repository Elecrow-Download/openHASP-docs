## Flashing
This device uses the native USB Serial on the ESP32-C3. To put the module into flashing mode, hold the boot button (xxx button on the back, when viewed with the display facedown and the USB port facing towards you) while clicking the reset button (other bottom facing button). After this, it can be flashed as usual.

After flashing, click the reset button to boot OpenHASP. After setup, the display will be inverted - to fix this, navigate to Configuration &gt; Display Settings and enable "Invert Display".
