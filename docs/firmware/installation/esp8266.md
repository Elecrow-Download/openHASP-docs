# Flash ESP8266

The performance of the ESP8266 will be slow due to its low memory and CPU frequency.
It is okay for getting started, for small project where speed is not needed or when you have one at hand.

!!! warning
    ESP8266 support will be removed in a future update. Please migrate to the ESP32.

## Download the firmware

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/HASwitchPlate/openHASP/releases){target=_blank} page on GitHub to download the latest openHASP binaries.

Pick the one appropriate for ESP8266:

- d1-mini-esp8266_ili9341_v0.6.0.bin

!!! note
    You can also download the *nightly* openHASP firmware.zip file from the [Actions tab](https://github.com/HASwitchPlate/openHASP/actions){target=_blank} on Github.

## Install the firmware

### Flash ESP8266

For ESP8266 you only need one single `.bin` file:

#### Using [Tasmotizer](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer){target=_blank}

#### Using esp-tool.py

When flashing the ESP8266 for the first time, it is best to erase the flash before uploading the new firmware:

```sh linenums="1"
esptool.py -p "COM1" erase_flash
esptool.py -p "COM1" write_flash --flash_mode qio 0x0 d1-mini-esp8266_ili9341_v0.6.0.bin
```

Change `COM1` to the correct port on your computer and `4m` to the correct size of the internal flash chip.
